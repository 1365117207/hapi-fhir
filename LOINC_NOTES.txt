TODO:
  In answer lists, figure out what to do with externally defined lists

Comments for Loinc:

Answer Lists
- Per the notes, there is no way in FHIR currently to map answer lists to
  codes based on context. For this reason, I am ignoring any entries in
  LoincAnswerListLink_Beta_1.csv where the "ApplicableContext" context is
  not empty. Is this correct?

Parts
- Only parts with a status of "ACTIVE" are being imported, any others are
  ignored.
- The PartTypeName (e.g. "ADJUSTMENT") is ignored as there is no corresponding
  property in loinc.xml
- PartDisplayName is not mapped
