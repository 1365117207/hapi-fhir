			<p>
				Every resource type defined by FHIR has a corresponding 
				class, which contains a number of getters and setters for 
				the basic properties of that resource.
			</p>

			<p>
				HAPI tries to make populating objects easier, by providing lots of 
				convenience methods. For example, the Observation resource has an
				"issued" property which is of the FHIR "instant" type (a system time with
				either seconds or milliseconds precision). There are methods to
				use the actual FHIR datatype, but also convenience methods which
				use built-in Java types.

			<subsection name="Navigating Structures">
			
				<p>
					Most HAPI structures provide getters that automatically create
					child objects on access. This means it is simple to navigate 
					complex structures without needing to worry about instantiating
					child objects.

			<subsection name="Coded/Enumerated Values">
			
				<p>
					There are many places in the FHIR specification where a "coded" string is
					used. This means that a code must be chosen from a list of allowable values.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					In these cases, HAPI tries to simplify the process by providing Java Enum
					types, which can be used to reduce complexity and provide compile-time
					checking.
