			<p>
				Resource references are a key part of the HAPI FHIR model, 
				since almost any resource will have references to other resources
				within it.
			</p>			
			
			<p>
				The <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/model/dstu/composite/ResourceReferenceDt.html">ResourceReferenceDt</a>
				type is the datatype for references. This datatype has a number of properties which help 
				make working with FHIR simple.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The <code>getReference()</code> method returns an IdDt instance which contains the identity of the
				resource being referenced. This is the item which is most commonly populated when
				interacting with FHIR. For example, consider the following Patient resource, which 
				contains a reference to an Organization resource: 
			</p>
			<source><![CDATA[<Patient xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
   <identifier>
      <system value="urn:mrns"/>
      <value value="253345"/>
   </identifier>
   <managingOrganization>
      <reference value="Organization/112"/>
   </managingOrganization>
</Patient>]]></source>
			
			<p>
				Given a Patient resource obtained by invoking a client operation, a call to 
				<code>IdDt ref = patient.getManagingOrganization().getReference();</code>
				returns an instance of IdDt which contains the "Organization/112" reference.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				ResourceReferenceDt also has a field for storing actual resource instances however,
				and this can be very useful.
			</p>
			

		</section>

		<section name="References in Client Code">
		
			<p>
				In client code, if a resource reference refers to a resource which was received as a
				part of the same response, <code>getResource()</code> will be populated with the 
				actual resource. This can happen because either the resource was received as a 
				contained resource, or the resource was received as a separate resource in a bundle.
			</p>
			
		</section>

		<section name="References in Server Code">
		
			<p>
				In server code, you may wish to return "contained" resources. A simple way to do this
				is to add these resources directly to the reference field and ensure that the resource
				has no ID populated. When this condition is detected, HAPI will automatically create a local
				reference ID and add the resource to the "contained" section when it encodes the resource. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following example shows a Patient resource being created which will have a
				contained resource as its managing organization when encoded from a server:
			</p>
			<source><![CDATA[Organization containedOrg = new Organization();
containedOrg.getName().setValue("Contained Test Organization");

Patient patient = new Patient();
patient.setId("Patient/1333");
patient.addIdentifier("urn:mrns", "253345");
patient.getManagingOrganization().setResource(patient);]]></source>
			
			<subsection name="Handling Includes (_include) in a Bundle">
				
				<p>
					Your server code may also wish to add additional resource to a bundle
					being returned (e.g. because of an _include directive in the client's request).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To do this, you can implement your server method to simply return 
					<code>List&lt;IResource&gt;</code> and then simply add your extra resources to
					the list. Another technique however, is to populate the reference as shown
					in the example above, but ensure that the referenced resource has an ID set.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					In the following example, the Organization resource has an ID set, so it will not
					be contained but will rather appear as a distinct entry in any returned
					bundles.
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[Organization org = new Organization();
org.setId("Organization/65546");
org.getName().setValue("Contained Test Organization");

Patient patient = new Patient();
patient.setId("Patient/1333");
patient.addIdentifier("urn:mrns", "253345");
patient.getManagingOrganization().setResource(patient);]]></source>
