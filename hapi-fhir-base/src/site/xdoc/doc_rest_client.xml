		<section name="Creating a RESTful Client">

			<macro name="toc">
			</macro>

			<p>
				HAPI provides a built-in mechanism for connecting to FHIR RESTful
				servers.
				The HAPI RESTful client is designed to be easy to set up and
				to allow strong
				compile-time type checking wherever possible.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are two types of clients provided by HAPI: Generic and Annotation-driven.
				The generic client (introduced in HAPI-FHIR 0.3) is much simpler to create
				and generally provides the faster way to get started. The annotation-driven
				client is more powerful and can rely on code generation to give better
				compile-time checking. 
			</p>

		</section>
		
		<section name="The Generic Client">
		
			<p>
				Creating a generic client simply requires you to create an instance of
				<code>FhirContext</code> and use that to instantiate a client.
			</p>			
			<p>
				The following example shows how to create a client, and a few operations which
				can be performed.
			</p>
			
			<macro name="snippet">
				<param name="id" value="simple" />
				<param name="file"
					value="src/site/example/java/example/GenericClientExample.java" />
			</macro>
			
			<p> 
				<b>Performance Tip: </b> Note that FhirContext is an expensive object to create,
				so you should try to keep an instance around for the lifetime of your application. It
				is thread-safe so it can be passed as needed. Client instances, on the other hand, 
				are very inexpensive to create so you can create a new one for each request if needed 
				(although there is no requirement to do so, clients are reusable and thread-safe as well).  
			</p>
			
			<subsection name="Search/Query">
			
				<p>
					The generic client supports queries using a fluent interface
					which is inspired by the fantastic 
					<a href="http://ewoutkramer.github.io/fhir-net-api/client-search.html">.NET FHIR API</a>.
					The fluent interface allows you to construct powerful queries by chaining
					method calls together, leading to highly readable code. It also allows
					you to take advantage of intellisense/code completion in your favourite
					IDE.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The following example shows how to query using this interface:
				</p>

				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="fluentExample" />
					<param name="file"
						value="src/site/example/java/example/GenericClientExample.java" />
				</macro>

		<section name="The Annotation-Driven Client">

			<p>
				The design of the annotation-driven client
				is intended to be similar to that of
				JAX-WS, so users of that
				specification should be comfortable with
				this one. It uses a user-defined interface containing special
				annotated methods which HAPI binds to calls against a server.
			</p>

			<subsection name="Defining A Restful Client Interface">

				<p>
					The first step in creating a FHIR RESTful Client is to define a
					restful client interface.
				</p>

				<p>
					A restful client interface class must extend the
					<a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/rest/client/api/IRestfulClient.html">IRestfulClient</a>
					interface,
					and will contain one or more methods which have been
					annotated with special annotations indicating which RESTful
					operation
					that method supports. Below is a simple example of a
					resource provider
					which supports the
					<a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html#read">read</a>
					operation (i.e. retrieve a single resource by ID) as well as the
					<a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html#search">search</a>
					operation (i.e. find any resources matching a given criteria) for a
					specific
					search criteria.
				</p>

				<p>
					You may notice that this interface looks a lot like the Resource
					Provider
					which is defined for use by the RESTful server. In fact, it
					supports all
					of the same annotations and is essentially identical,
					other than the
					fact that for a client you must use an interface but for a server you
					must use a concrete class with method implementations.
				</p>

				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="provider" />
					<param name="file"
						value="src/site/example/java/example/RestfulClientImpl.java" />
				</macro>

				<p>
					You will probably want to add more methods
					to your client interface.
					See
					<a href="./doc_rest_operations.html">RESTful Operations</a>
					for
					lots more examples of how to add methods for various operations.
				</p>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Instantiate the Client">

				<p>
					Once your client interface is created, all that is left is to
					create a FhirContext and instantiate the client and you are
					ready to
					start using it.
				</p>

				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="client" />
					<param name="file"
						value="src/site/example/java/example/ExampleRestfulClient.java" />
				</macro>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="A Complete Example">
	
				<p>
					The following is a complete example showing a RESTful client
					using
					HAPI FHIR.
				</p>
	
				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="client" />
					<param name="file"
						value="src/site/example/java/example/CompleteExampleClient.java" />
				</macro>

		</section>

		<section name="Configuring the Client">

			<p>
				RESTful clients (both Generic and Annotation-Driven) use 
				<a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/">Apache HTTP Client</a>
				as a provider. The Apache HTTP Client is very powerful and extremely flexible, 
				but can be confusing at first to configure, because of the low-level approach that
				the library uses. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In many cases, the default configuration should suffice. However, if you require anything
				more sophisticated (username/password, HTTP proxy settings, etc.) you will need
				to configure the underlying client. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The underlying client configuration is provided by setting an
				<a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/rest/client/IRestfulClientFactory.html#setHttpClient(org.apache.http.client.HttpClient)">HttpClient</a>
				on the RestfulClientFactory. 
			</p>

			<subsection name="HTTP Basic Authorization">

				<p>
					The following example shows how to configure your client to
					use a specific username and password in every request.
				</p>

				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="security" />
					<param name="file" value="src/site/example/java/example/ClientExamples.java" />
				</macro>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Configuring Encoding (JSON/XML)">

				<p>
					Restful client interfaces that you create will also extend
					the interface 
					<a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/rest/client/api/IRestfulClient.html">IRestfulClient</a>,
					which comes with some helpful methods for configuring the way that
					the client will interact with the server.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following snippet shows how to configure the cliet to explicitly 
					request JSON or XML responses, and how to request "pretty printed" responses
					on servers that support this (HAPI based servers currently).				
				</p>
				
				<macro name="snippet">
					<param name="id" value="clientConfig" />
					<param name="file" value="src/site/example/java/example/ClientExamples.java" />
				</macro>
