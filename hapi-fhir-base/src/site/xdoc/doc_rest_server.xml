			<p>
				HAPI provides a built-in mechanism for adding FHIR's RESTful Server
				capabilities to your applications. The HAPI RESTful Server is Servlet
				based, so it should be easy to deploy to any of the many compliant
				containers that exist.					
			</p>

			<p>
				Setup is mostly done using simple annotations, which means that it should
				be possible to create a FHIR compliant server quickly and easily.
			</p>
			
			<subsection name="Creating A Server">
			
				<p>
					The first step in creating a FHIR RESTful Server is to define one or
					more resource providers. A resource provider is a class which is 
					able to supply exactly one type of resource to be served up.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For example, if you wish to allow your server to serve up Patient, 
					Observation and Location resources, you will need three resource
					providers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Resource providers each contain one or more methods which have been
					annotated with special annotations indicating which RESTful operation
					that method supports. Below is a simple example of a resource provider
					which supports the
					<a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html#read">read</a>
					operation (i.e. retrieve a single resource by ID) as well as the
					<a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html#search">search</a>
					operation (i.e. find any resources matching a given criteria) for a specific
					search criteria.
