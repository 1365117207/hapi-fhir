 <p> <b>August 30, 2016 - HAPI FHIR 2.0 Released</b> - The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and GitHub's releases section. </p> 
 <p> This release brings several primary changes: </p> 
 <ul> 
  <li> The JSON parser used by HAPI's parser module has been switched from <a class="externalLink" href="https://jsonp.java.net/">JSR353/JSONP</a> to <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/google/gson">Google GSON</a>. This should be an invisible change for most users (the only thing that broke for us was that a few extra spaces are inserted in pretty-printed encoding and this broke some overly sensitive unit tests). Gson is a much more active project than JSONP and should be better supported in the future. </li> 
  <li> STU3 definitions have been updated to the FHIR 1.6.0 2016 September Ballot Candidate definitions (aka the 2016 Baltimore Connectathon version). </li> 
  <li> Content-Types emitted by the library have been updated to use the new content type strings proposed for use as of STU3 (when using HAPI in STU3 mode). E.g. <tt>application/fhir+xml</tt> insead of the previous <tt>application/xml+fhir</tt> </li> 
 </ul> 
 <p> This release also brings a number of bugfixes and also quite a few enhancements. As always, the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a> has the full list of changes in this version. Among the enhancements in this release are: </p> 
 <p> As always, we welcome new contributions and contributors! Please feel free to get in touch if you are interested in getting involved with HAPI but don't know where to start. </p>

 <p> <b>July 7, 2016 - HAPI FHIR 1.6 Released</b> - The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and GitHub's releases section. </p> 
 <p> This release brings a number of bugfixes and also quite a few enhancements. As always, the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a> has the full list of changes in this version. Among the enhancements in this release are: </p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Significant enhancements to FhirContext startup performance (especially on Android)</li> 
  <li>Support for STU3 terminology services in the JPA module, including support for importing SNOMED CT and LOINC</li> 
  <li>Update of the STU3 resources and validator to the latest snapshot</li> 
  <li>Plenty of bug fixes</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p> As always, thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, either though pull requests, bug reports, suggestions, and helping us test new features. </p> 
 <p> Also, a few quick community notes: </p> 
 <p> <b>On DSTU3 naming:</b> FMG has decided to rename the upcoming FHIR <tt>DSTU3</tt> (draft standard for trial use) release to <tt>STU3</tt> (standard for trial use). In order to avoid breaking existing software, we will <b>NOT</b> be renaming the <tt>hapi-fhir-structures-dstu3</tt> module of HAPI. We will be updating documentation on the site to reflect the new name wherever it won't be confusing, but be aware that this is a potential source of confusion. </p> 
 <p> <b>On the HAPI FHIR website: </b> Regular visitors to our site will probably already have noticed that we recently moved the site to a new URL ( <a class="externalLink" href="http://hapifhir.io">http://hapifhir.io</a> ). This was done mostly to help make HAPI's URL a bit easier to remember. </p> 
 <p> <b>On the future: </b> For the next release, we are planning on moving away from the <tt>javax.json</tt> (JSR 353) library in favour of using Google GSON. JSR 353 seemed like a good choice when we started HAPI, but it has basically been abandoned and no longer seems like a good choice (especially given the headaches it causes on Android). This hopefully means that the next release will be able to do away with the &quot;special&quot; Android shade-jar releases and all of the Gradle file gymnastics that are required in order to use them. </p> 
 <p> As always, we welcome new contributions and contributors! Please feel free to get in touch if you are interested in getting involved with HAPI but don't know where to start. </p>

					This release fixes a security vulnerability in the XML parser. See
					GitHub <a href="https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/issues/339">Issue #339</a>
					for information.
				</li>
				<li>
					This release adds support for the current draft STU3 structure definitions,
					known as FHIR 1.4.0 (or the Montreal Connectathon Snapshot). See the 
					<a href="./downloads.html">downloads page</a> for information on the
					various versions of FHIR supported by HAPI FHIR.
				</li>
				<li>
					A new

					has been added.
				</li>
				<li>
					A 
					<a href="./doc_rest_server_security.html">Server Security Interceptor</a>
					has been added.
				</li>
				<li>
					The JPA server has been enhanced so that search results are now paged into
					the database instead of simply to memory. This makes the server much more
					scalable to supporting larger result sets, larger volumes of queries, and
					operation across multiple nodes in a cluster.

				The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and

			</p>
			<p>
				This release has taken a lot longer than originally planned. Mainly this
				is because we have taken a number of huge steps towards integrating
				HAPI FHIR with the HL7.org Java Reference Implementation. This 
				effort will mean great things for all Java FHIR developers from now
				on, as it will bring a rich set of tools to everyone. See the
				<a href="./doc_dstu2.html">DSTU3/RI page</a> for information on
				this effort.

				This release brings a number of bugfixes and a few bigger things.
				As always, the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a> has the full list
				of changes in this version. Some changes of note include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This release adds support for the current draft DSTU3 structure definitions,
					which were called DSTU2.1 until the decision in January by HL7 to call the
					next release DSTU3. See the 
					<a href="./downloads.html">downloads page</a> for information on the
					various versions of FHIR supported by HAPI FHIR.
				</li>
				<li>
					Two great new modules to HAPI FHIR have been contributed to the
					project! A huge thanks to both contributors for their ongoing
					efforts.
					<li>
						A new OSGi module (<a href="http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g%3A%22ca.uhn.hapi.fhir%22%20AND%20a%3A%22hapi-fhir-osgi-core%22">hapi-fhir-osgi-core</a>) has been contributed
						by
						<a href="https://www.akana.com/">Akana</a>. This module was originally added in the 1.3 release cycle but
						was cleaned up for use in 1.4.
					</li> 
					<li>
						A new adapter 
						(<a href="./doc_rest_server_jaxrs.html">hapi-fhir-jaxrsserver-base</a>)
						which allows the RESTful server to be used in JAX-RS environment
						was contributed by <a href="http://www.agfahealthcare.com/">AGFA Healthcare</a>.
					</li>
				</li>
				<li>
					The Command-Line tool (<a href="./doc_cli.html">hapi-fhir-cli</a>) has been
					given options to start the server and uploader tools in either DSTU2
					or DSTU3 mode. Both are supported by the same tool installation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Several of HAPI's library dependencies have been upgraded to the latest version
					(see the first entry in the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a>)

				<li>
					The JPA server now uses Lucene (via Hibernate Search) as an added indexing
					mechanism. This allows the server to support fulltext searching via the
					<code>_content</code> and <code>_text</code> search parameters.
				</li>
				<li>
					The JPA server has been converted from using Spring XML configuration to

				<b>July 13, 2015 - HAPI FHIR 1.1 Released</b> - HAPI 1.1 has been released! 
				As always, you can see the complete list of what has
				changed by consulting the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a>, and the
				<a href="./download.html">download page</a> has information on where to get it.
			</p>
			<p>
				HAPI FHIR 1.1 is the first release with support for the HL7.org "reference implementation"
				structures. This is an exciting development for us, as it means the beginning of
				our move to bring the two Java implementations of FHIR together into one library.
				As a part of this harmonization, we have made a few minor API changes. Specifically,
				a few methods that previously returned 
				<code><a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/model/api/IResource.html">IResource</a></code> 
				or 
				<code><a href="./apidocs/ca/uhn/fhir/model/primitive/IdDt.html">IdDt</a></code>
				will now return parent interfaces of these classes: 
				<code><a href="./apidocs/org/hl7/fhir/instance/model/api/IBaseResource.html">IBaseResource</a></code> 
				and
				<code><a href="./apidocs/org/hl7/fhir/instance/model/api/IIdType.html">IIdType</a></code>
				respectively.
				Existing code can simply cast to IResource and IdDt as these classes are still in use, but
				new code may wish to take advantage of the new "RI" structures. During the next development
				cycle we will be integrating features from the HL7.org Java FHIR packages into HAPI, such as the
				instance/profile validator and the narrative generator.
			</p>
			<p> 
				See the <a href="./doc_dstu2.html">HAPI DSTU2 documentation</a> page for
				more information.

				<b>May 8, 2015 - HAPI FHIR 1.0 Released</b> - HAPI 1.0 has been released! As always, 1.0 brings lots of fixes and features, and also brings the DSTU2 model classes up to the May 2015 DSTU2 ballot candidate structure definitions. Upgrading is recommended.

				At the same time, I am uploading the first builds of HAPI FHIR 1.1-SNAPSHOT. In the next release cycle we are introducing support for the FHIR reference implementation structures. This is an exciting development because it marks the beginning of an effort to merge the two libraries. This will mean that RI users can take advantage of HAPI's powerful client and server frameworks, and HAPI users can take advantage of the RI's powerful validation tooling.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will note that 1.1 will bring a few minor API changes, so upgrading your application to this level may require a few tweaks. Specifically, a new interface (IBaseResource) has been introduced which acts as a superinterface for both HAPI's structures and the RI ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				The existing IResource (HAPI's resource interface) extends this new interface, as does an interface called IRefImplInterface which marks RI structures. Some methods in the parser and in the client which previously returned IResource (HAPI's resource interface) now return IBaseResource, so a cast to IResource may be required in some cases. If you are feeling adventurous and want to give these structures a spin, go for it! Feel free to post questions here.

				<b>March 14, 2015 - HAPI FHIR 0.9 Released</b> - HAPI 0.9 has now been released. This 
				release is an important one. It brings a number of fixes and new features, and most importantly
				brings suport for DSTU2 resources and parsing/encoding. DSTU2 is the upcoming next version
				of the FHIR specification itself. Also of particular note, the 
				<a href="./doc_jpa.html">JPA Server</a> has graduated to being included in the
				Maven repos (so you can create your own server which works just like <a href="http://fhirtest.uhn.ca">ours</a>).
				The <a href="./doc_android.html">Android JAR</a> has also been included.

				As always, you can see the complete list of what has
				changed by consulting the <a href="./changes-report.html">changelog</a>, and the
				<a href="./download.html">download page</a> has information on where to get it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Note on DSTU2:</b> It is important to note that DSTU2 is not yet formally ballotted by HL7, and as such it 
				is subject to change. A number of developers are starting to target it however, so support
				was important to us at HAPI HQ. See the <a href="./doc_dstu2.html">HAPI DSTU2 page</a>
				for information about how to add support for FHIR DSTU2 in your applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>What's Next:</b> We are planning on making the next release of HAPI be the 1.0 release.
				The biggest development on our plate for the next development cycle will be to finish
				the integration of the HL7.org structure classes. Some people may have noticed a project
				in our GitHub repo called "hapi-fhir-structures-hl7org" that isn't a part of the current build.
				What we are trying to do is to unify the HL7.org Java Reference Implementation data model with
				the HAPI one in a single set of classes. This will mean that HAPI users can take advantage
				of tools from the RI (such as the excellent validator that comes with it) and users of the
				RI can take advantage of HAPI's client and server toolkits. It is still not 100% clear what
				this integration will look like when it is complete, but that should become clear in the 
				coming weeks.
			</p>
			<p>
				As always, thanks to everyone who contributed code, pull requests, and filed bugs to make
				this release better. HAPI FHIR is the collective work of a large number of people now
				and we all benefit from the collective hard work being put in from around the world!

				<b>Dec 17, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.8 Released</b> - HAPI 0.8 has been released!
				As always, thanks to everyone who contributed on this; this release includes
				a lot of bug fixes and new features from around the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				See the <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/changes-report.html">changelog</a>
				for a complete list of what's new!
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, this release marks the beginning of our push to separate the model
				classes (e.g. Patient, Encounter, etc.) from the core API, so that you can use any 
				version of the structures you want in your application, or even combine versions if 
				you need to. As is the case with HAPI's HL7 v2 library, you now need to include at least
				one new separate "structures" JAR with your application as of HAPI-FHIR 0.8. See the
				<a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/doc_upgrading.html">Upgrading</a>
				and
				<a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/download.html">Download</a>
				pages for more information.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the newly separated "structures" dependencies, we have also introduced
				a separate "dev" version of the structures, which contains the current development
				structure definitions, which are now close to being in their final DSTU2 state 
				(DSTU2 should be released in mid 2015 by HL7 although the date is not yet finalized).
				DSTU2 contains a number of new and updated resource definitions, but it also makes
				several infrastructure changes including a new Bundle format and a new encoding style
				for extensions in JSON. These changes are not yet supported in HAPI-FHIR 0.8, but
				will be included in HAPI-FHIR 0.9. We expect to deploy a working snapshot build of
				HAPI-FHIR 0.9 within the next day or so, including all of these changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				One further note: We are currently working with Grahame Grieve on an initiative
				to harmonize HAPI's model objects with the FHIR Java Reference Implementation. This
				means that developers should in the future be able to use either the HAPI built-in
				resource definitions or the ones shipped by HL7. The advantage to this is that
				it will allow users of HAPI's API to take advantage of other tooling produced
				by HL7 (such as profile validators). Please get in touch (either by email or
				on the Google Group) if you would like to help test this.

				<b>Oct 23, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.7 Released</b> - HAPI 0.7 has been released!
				This release contains a number of contributions and bugfixes from all over
				the FHIR community. Thanks to everyone who contributed!
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, note that this release corrects an issue where contained resources 
				sometimes got encoded as both contained and top-level resources, and top level 
				resources sometimes got encoded as contained resources. It is possible that some 
				existing applications depended on the buggy behaviour, so please do a bit of extra 
				testing on your server applications if you use contained resources at all. See 
				the <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/doc_resource_references.html">resource references</a>
				documentation for a bit more information on how these work, and please feel free to 
				post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/hapi-fhir">google group</a>
				if things aren't working as expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release also introduces a fascinating <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>
				based development environment contributed by Preston Lee which should allow you 
				to try out a fully functional, database backed HAPI server in a virtual server 
				on your own development box.

				<b>July 30, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.5 Released</b> - HAPI 0.5 has now been released.
				This is surprisingly soon after the last release (and probably not a 
				pace we will sustain) but we landed a number of big fixes and enhancements
				over the last two weeks and it just didn't make sense to hold them.
				See the <a href="./doc_upgrading.html">upgrading page</a> for information on 
				API changes in this release.

				<b>July 14, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.4 Released</b> - The next release of HAPI has been
				tagged an uploaded to the Maven global repos and the GitHub releases section. See the changelog
				for more information. This release contains a large number of minor bugfixes and quite a few new
				features. Upgrading should be relatively simple, although there is one breaking API change (IdDt
				now can contain the complete URL of a resource, not just the logical ID).

				<b>May 12, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.3 Released</b> - A new release of HAPI FHIR has been deployed
				to the Maven repos and the Sourceforge download system. This release corrects a large number of 
				bugs and includes fixes which were implemented in the recent FHIR Connectathon.
